# Song words highlighter

This is just a thing, that I though would be nice to do as homework for music classes. Well, I didn't sleep well that day.
Project highlights words in the [Stepan Pantera (by hatespeech)](https://open.spotify.com/track/5v8hNpm9pSAjeNRUwvbHk5) song.

Song is hardcoded and all timings are set manually. Words in the song are described in `src/routes/+page.svelte` and
timings are in `src/lib/data.ts`.
